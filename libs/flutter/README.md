# reblaze

The Reblaze Flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and iOS.

The plugin is a thin wrapper around the Reblaze Mobile SDK, it links to `mobile-sdk-2.0.aar` for Android and to `ReblazeSDK.xcframework` for iOS.
